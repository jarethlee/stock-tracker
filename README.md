# CS50W CAPSTONE PROJECT: STOCK TRACKER

## Overview
Stock Tracker is a comprehensive web application designed to help users track and analyse their stock portfolios. The application leverages Django for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend to provide a robust and user-friendly experience. It incorporates real-time stock data, historical analysis, portfolio management, and news aggregation to keep users informed about their investments.

I set out to create an interactive web application to allow beginnners to try their hands at playing the stock market (risk-free!) by tracking the performance of the stocks which they are interested in. The main components are:

* Home Page (This displays all news articles related to stocks which the user has searched for. This has already been prefilled with some of the most popular stocks such as AAPL, NVDA, GOOG, META, etc.)
* Login/Logout/Register
* Search for stocks via their symbols
* A stock details page which displays all information relevant to the company and stock
* A portfolio page tracking the performance of stocks that were "purchased" via the stock details page

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
Stock Tracker is distinct from other projects in the CS50W course in several key ways:

- **Complexity and Scope**: Unlike the simpler e-commerce or social networking applications, Stock Tracker integrates multiple APIs (Finnhub, Yahoo Finance, News API) to fetch real-time and historical stock and news data, which is then processed and presented in a user-friendly manner. This involves handling large datasets, performing calculations for portfolio metrics, and rendering complex visualisations. Suffice to say that Stock Tracker is more than sufficiently distinct from all the other projects in this course, and is also not based on the old CS50W Pizza project. More than 1 Django model was used, and JavaScript was used extensively on the front-end.
- **Functionality**: The application includes advanced features such as dynamic portfolio performance updates, stock detail views with extensive data (market data, financial metrics, etc.), historical data charts, and a news aggregation system. These functionalities go beyond the typical CRUD operations found in standard projects.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: The application is fully mobile-responsive, ensuring that users have a seamless experience across different devices. This involves using responsive design principles and testing on various screen sizes.
- **User Experience**: Emphasis is placed on providing a clean, intuitive user interface with smooth interactions. Features like dynamic data updates using JavaScript, interactive charts, and hover effects enhance the user experience.
